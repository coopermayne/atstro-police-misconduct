On June 15, 2023, John Smith, a 35-year-old teacher, was stopped by LAPD officers near his home in South Los Angeles for an alleged traffic violation. Body camera footage shows the interaction quickly escalated when Smith questioned why he was being stopped.

Despite Smith complying with officer commands and showing no signs of aggression, Officer Rodriguez used a taser on him multiple times. Smith was then forcibly removed from his vehicle and placed in a chokehold by Officer Martinez while other officers looked on.

Smith suffered a dislocated shoulder, fractured ribs, and psychological trauma from the incident. He filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 USC § 1983 alleging excessive force and violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

The case settled in March 2024 for $875,000, with no admission of wrongdoing by the department. Both officers remain on active duty.
