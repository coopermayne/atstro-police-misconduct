# Case Draft

> **How this works:** Write all the facts below. The AI will extract metadata and
> rewrite this into an encyclopedic article (Wikipedia-style: neutral, factual, no
> emotional language). Just focus on getting the information down.

## Victim Info

Include whatever you know:

```
Name: John Smith
Age: 34
Date of incident: February 10, 2023
Location: Palmdale, California (Los Angeles County)
Agency: Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
```

The AI will extract: name, age, gender (from pronouns), race (only if explicitly
stated—never assumed), location, agencies, armed status, cause of death, etc.

## What Happened

Write the incident details. Can be any format—bullet points, paragraphs, copy-pasted
text from news articles or court documents. Include:

- Timeline of events (what happened when)
- What force was used (shooting, taser, physical, etc.)
- Whether victim was armed and with what
- Officer names if known
- Statements made by anyone involved

Example:
```
Deputies responded to a domestic disturbance call around 10 PM. They were told
the subject had made "suicide by cop" statements and the Mental Evaluation Team
could respond in 30 minutes.

Wife told deputies her husband hadn't hurt anyone, no guns in the house, he was
having a mental health crisis. Deputies entered anyway without consent.

In the backyard, victim was holding a sword, saying "kill me" and "just shoot me."
One deputy fired a less-lethal 40mm round while another deputy simultaneously
shot victim in the head, killing him.
```

## Background

Optional: victim's personal background, family, occupation. Humanizes the case.

## Legal Details

Include if known:
- Case name and number (e.g., *Smith v. County of Los Angeles*, 2:23-cv-09285)
- Court and judge
- Investigation status (under investigation, charges filed, no charges, settled)
- Settlement amount
- Trial date
