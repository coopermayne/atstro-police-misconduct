# Blog Post Draft

> **How this works:** Write your content below. The AI will completely rewrite it
> into a polished article with proper structure, headings, and a Key Takeaways section.
> Don't worry about formatting—just focus on the information.

## Topic

[One-line description of the article topic]

## Key Points

Write the actual content you want covered. This can be:
- Rough paragraphs explaining concepts
- Bullet points with facts and arguments
- Copy-pasted research notes
- Unstructured information dumps

**The AI will:**
- Reorganize everything for best flow
- Create appropriate section headings
- Write in an engaging, professional tone
- Add a "Key Takeaways" section with 3-5 bullet points
- Expand brief notes into full paragraphs

**What NOT to include:**
- Section headings (AI creates these)
- "Key Takeaways" (AI adds this)
- Introduction/conclusion structure (AI handles this)

Just write the substance. Example:

```
Qualified immunity was created by the Supreme Court, not Congress.
The "clearly established" standard from Harlow v. Fitzgerald (1982)
makes it nearly impossible for victims to sue police officers.

Courts can dismiss cases without deciding if rights were violated,
which means rights never become "clearly established" - creating
a catch-22 for plaintiffs.

Examples where officers got immunity:
- Officers who stole $225,000 during a search warrant
- Officer who shot a child while aiming at a non-threatening dog
```

## Media

Paste URLs to images, videos, or documents. Describe what each one is.
