**Key Points to Cover:**
- What is qualified immunity and where did it come from?
- How the Supreme Court created this doctrine (not Congress)
- The "clearly established law" standard and why it's so hard to meet
- Real examples of egregious cases where officers got immunity
- Recent reform efforts at state and federal levels
- What this means for victims seeking justice

## Content Ideas

### History
- Pierson v. Ray (1967) - origins
- Harlow v. Fitzgerald (1982) - "clearly established" standard
- How it evolved from good faith immunity to something much broader

### The Catch-22
- Courts can dismiss cases without deciding if rights were violated
- This means rights never become "clearly established"
- Creates impossible burden: need prior case with nearly identical facts

### Shocking Examples Where Officers Got Immunity
- Officers who stole $225,000 during search warrant execution
- Officer who shot 10-year-old boy while aiming at non-threatening dog
- Officers who used police dog on surrendered suspect
- Officer who shot someone for moving during Terry stop

### Reform Efforts
- Federal legislation proposed but not passed (George Floyd Justice in Policing Act)
- Bipartisan support from some conservatives (Institute for Justice)

### What Victims Need to Know
- QI applies to § 1983 civil rights lawsuits, not criminal cases
- It's raised as a defense, not automatic protection
- Importance of experienced civil rights attorney
- Alternative state law claims may avoid QI
- Documentation is critical

### Current Landscape
- Supreme Court increasingly skeptical of expanding QI (recent cases denied)
- Justice Thomas has questioned the doctrine's validity
- Lower courts struggling with when to apply it
- State-level reforms gaining momentum

## Tone
Educational, accessible, factual. Explain complex legal concepts in plain language. Balance criticism of the doctrine with objective explanation of how it works.
