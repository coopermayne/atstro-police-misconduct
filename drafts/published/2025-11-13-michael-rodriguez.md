## What Happened

Michael Rodriguez, 28-year-old construction worker, was stopped by SDPD officers for expired vehicle registration. During the stop, officers claimed he was "acting suspicious" and ordered him out of the vehicle. 

When Rodriguez asked why he was being removed from his car, officers forcibly pulled him out and tased him twice. He fell to the ground and officers placed him in restraints, causing injuries to his wrists and shoulder.

Body camera footage shows Rodriguez was calm and compliant throughout the encounter. He repeatedly asked officers what he had done wrong but received no clear answer.

## Notes
This is a good example of how body camera footage contradicts officer reports. The officers' written report said Rodriguez was "combative" but the video clearly shows he was cooperative.
