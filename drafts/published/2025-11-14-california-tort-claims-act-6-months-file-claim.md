### What is the California Tort Claims Act?

The CTCA (Government Code §§ 810-996.6) sets special rules for suing government entities in California - including cities, counties, and state agencies that employ police officers.

**Key principle:** Sovereign immunity - government can't be sued unless it consents. The CTCA is California's consent, but with strict conditions.

### The Critical 6-Month Deadline

**For personal injury/death:** Must file administrative claim within 6 months of the incident
**For property damage:** 6 months for damage to personal property

This is NOT the same as statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit. This is a prerequisite to even being allowed to sue.

### What the Administrative Claim Must Include

**Required information:**
- Name and address of claimant
- Address for notices
- Date, place, and circumstances of the incident
- General description of injury/damage/loss
- Name of public employees involved (if known)
- Amount claimed (if less than $10,000, must state exact amount)


### Where to File

Depends on which agency you're claiming against:
- **City police:** City clerk's office
- **County sheriff:** County clerk or county counsel
- **California Highway Patrol:** State controller or CHP headquarters

**Must file with correct entity or claim may be rejected on technicality!**

### What Happens After Filing

**Timeline:**
1. Entity has 45 days to respond
2. Can reject claim, accept claim (rare), or do nothing
3. If no response in 45 days = deemed rejected
4. Claimant then has 6 months to file lawsuit in court
5. If claim accepted (very rare), parties negotiate settlement

**Reality check:** 
- Most claims are rejected as a matter of course
- Rejection doesn't mean your case lacks merit
- It's just a procedural requirement before lawsuit
- The real evaluation happens in court

### The Consequences of Missing the Deadline

**If you miss the 6-month deadline:**
- You generally CANNOT sue in California state court
- Your state law claims are barred forever
- Federal claims (§ 1983) are NOT affected by CTCA
- But you lose valuable alternative claims

**Why this matters:**
- State law claims avoid qualified immunity
- State law may provide different theories of liability
- Can sue entity directly, not just individual officers
- May have more favorable damages rules

### Limited Exceptions to the Deadline

**Late claims MAY be allowed if:**
- You were physically/mentally incapacitated
- You were a minor without guardian
- You died (estate can file within one year)
- The public entity has actual knowledge and isn't prejudiced

**BUT:** These are narrow exceptions. Don't count on them. File on time.


### Federal vs State Claims

**Federal § 1983 Claims:**
- Not subject to CTCA requirements
- Can be filed directly in federal court
- Different 2-year statute of limitations
- Subject to qualified immunity defense

**State Law Claims:**
- Must comply with CTCA
- 6-month claim requirement
- Can sue entity itself (vicarious liability)
- Not subject to qualified immunity
- Caps on certain damages

**Strategy:** Most lawyers file BOTH
- Federal claims in federal court (or state court)
- State claims after CTCA compliance
- Often combined in same lawsuit

### Practical Advice for Victims

**Immediately after incident:**
1. Seek medical attention (creates documentation)
2. Photograph injuries, scene, evidence
3. Get witness contact information
4. Request body camera/dashcam footage under CPRA
5. **Contact attorney IMMEDIATELY**

**Why urgency matters:**
- 6 months passes quickly
- Gathering evidence takes time
- Medical records need to be requested
- Police reports need to be obtained
- Claim needs to be drafted carefully

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't wait to see if criminal charges are filed
- Don't wait for internal affairs investigation
- Don't assume you have "plenty of time"
- Don't try to file claim yourself without attorney review

### Common Mistakes

**Mistakes that can derail your case:**
- Filing with wrong entity
- Missing critical information in claim
- Understating the claim amount
- Missing the 6-month deadline entirely
- Not preserving evidence early

### How to Find the Right Attorney

**Look for:**
- Experience with § 1983 and CTCA cases
- Track record with police misconduct cases
- Understanding of both federal and state claims
- Ability to handle complex litigation

**Most civil rights attorneys:**
- Offer free consultations
- Work on contingency (no fee unless you win)
- Can advise on CTCA compliance


### The Bottom Line

**Key takeaways:**
1. **6 months is the critical deadline** - don't miss it
2. **See a lawyer immediately** after the incident
3. **CTCA is a procedural hurdle**, not the end of the case
4. **Federal claims exist as alternative** if deadline missed
5. **Documentation from day one** is crucial

The CTCA creates a major trap for unwary victims. But with proper guidance and timely action, it's a manageable hurdle on the path to justice.
