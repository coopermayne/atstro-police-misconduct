Everett Byram Obituary
Everett was born in Kennewick, WA, in 1988 to Morris and Valorie Byram. When he was two years old, he moved with his parents to Russellville, AR, where he attended Russellville High School and Arkansas Tech University. He then moved to Fayetteville, AR, where he met his wife-to-be, Ursula. After brief stints in Virginia and Arizona, he made his way to Hollywood, where he pursued a career in comedy since 2015. There, he became a well-known meme-maker, online satirist, and comedic writer, garnering up to seventy thousand followers on his personal Twitter account and 259,000 followers on an Instagram page he started and managed. His writing has appeared on The Daily Dot and SOVO Magazine, and his comedy has been written about by the New York Post and Rolling Stone magazine. His memes have appeared on Knowyourmeme.com and Steve Harveys Steve TV.
Everett loved his family. When he was younger, he wanted to be a musician, and if you asked him to, he would pick up a guitar to show you the songs he wrote to his children to sing them to sleep. He was an exceptional cook, getting excited about new ingredients found in hole-in-the-wall stores, and he would make sure you had a plate to try whatever he was putting together. Long before he started a career in comedy, he showed a talent for making people laugh. His whole life, he felt most at home when he had gotten you to smile.
Everett left us on February 10. The first of nine siblings, Everett leaves behind his 15-year-old son, Atticus; one-year-old twins, Sylas and Nyomi; and his wife, Ursula, in Palmdale, California.
