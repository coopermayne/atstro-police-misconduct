- Keep safe distance
- Don't physically interfere
- Continue recording even if ordered to stop (but comply with lawful orders to leave area)
- Know your rights if phone is seized

### What to Document During the Encounter

**If you're directly involved:**
- Record if safely possible
- Mental notes: officer names/badge numbers
- Exact words spoken (especially threats, racial slurs, commands)
- What force was used and when
- Whether you were complying
- Witnesses present

**If you're observing:**
- Record from safe distance
- Multiple angles if possible
- Before/during/after if possible
- Don't just record the exciting moment - context matters
- Narrate what you're seeing if safe to do so
- Get establishing shots showing location


### Immediately After the Encounter

**Within hours:**
1. **Seek medical attention** - even for minor injuries
   - Creates contemporaneous medical record
   - Photographs of injuries by medical professional
   - Documents your complaints of pain/injury
   
2. **Photograph everything**
   - All injuries from multiple angles
   - Torn/damaged clothing
   - Location/scene if possible
   - Any property damage
   - Continue photographing as bruises develop

3. **Write down everything**
   - Create detailed timeline while memory fresh
   - Every detail you can remember
   - What you said, what officers said
   - Who else was present
   - Include emotions/thoughts at the time

4. **Preserve all evidence**
   - Don't wash torn/bloody clothing
   - Don't repair damaged property yet
   - Keep everything in paper bags (not plastic)
   - Photograph before storing


### Getting Witness Information

**Critical importance:**
- Police reports may be inaccurate or biased
- Officer testimony may differ from reality
- Independent witnesses can corroborate your account

**How to gather:**
- Get full names and phone numbers
- Ask if they recorded anything
- Ask what they saw
- Don't coach them - just document
- If they're reluctant, at least get first name and phone

**What if witnesses are gone?**
- Canvass the area next day
- Post on local social media
- Check if businesses have surveillance cameras
- Return to location at same time/day of week

### Requesting Body Camera and Dashcam Footage

**California law (CPRA - California Public Records Act):**
- You can request bodycam/dashcam footage
- Within 45 days if you were subject of encounter
- May take longer if ongoing investigation
- May require fee for redaction

**How to request:**
1. Identify the correct agency
2. Submit written request citing CPRA
3. Be as specific as possible (date, time, location, officers)
4. Include your contact information
5. Specify format (digital preferred)

**Timeline:**
- Agency has 10 days to respond
- May take 45-60 days to actually receive
- Can be delayed for ongoing investigations
- Can be denied in some circumstances (national security, ongoing prosecution)

### Medical Documentation

**Why it's critical:**
- Contemporaneous evidence of injury
- Professional assessment and documentation
- Medical records are powerful evidence
- Treatment creates paper trail

**What to tell medical providers:**
- Exactly how injuries occurred
- All areas of pain/injury, even minor
- Emotional distress
- Request photographs
- Request detailed notes

**Follow-up care:**
- Keep all medical appointments
- Document ongoing issues
- Keep all receipts/bills
- Note impact on daily life

### What Can Hurt Your Case

**Common mistakes:**
- **Deleting or editing video** - looks like you're hiding something
- **Posting detailed account on social media** - can be used against you
- **Talking to media without lawyer** - can complicate case
- **Exaggerating injuries** - undermines credibility
- **Waiting too long** - remember 6-month CTCA deadline
- **Not preserving evidence** - can't recreate later
- **Washing/discarding clothing** - destroys evidence
- **Failing to document injuries** - they heal and disappear

**Social media pitfalls:**
- Insurance companies/lawyers WILL search your profiles
- Photos showing activities inconsistent with claimed injuries
- Posts about the incident can be taken out of context
- Private accounts aren't really private in litigation
- Set profiles to private, but better yet, pause posting

### Creating Your Evidence Package

**Organize everything:**
1. **Timeline document** - detailed chronological account
2. **Photos** - injuries, scene, property damage (organized by date)
3. **Videos** - yours and any obtained from witnesses
4. **Medical records** - all visits, bills, receipts
5. **Witness information** - names, contacts, statements
6. **Official documents** - police reports, citations, arrest records
7. **Impact statement** - how this affected your life

**Why organize early?**
- Will be crucial for attorney evaluation
- Shows you're serious and organized
- Easier to spot gaps in evidence
- Faster to file claims/lawsuits

### Special Considerations

**If you were arrested:**
- Don't discuss case on jail phones (recorded)
- Don't discuss with cellmates
- Still document injuries ASAP
- Request medical attention in custody
- Preserve all booking documents

**If deadly force was used:**
- Family should hire attorney immediately
- Request all recordings and dispatch logs
- Request autopsy reports
- Preserve decedent's clothing
- Document crime scene if accessible
- Mental health records may be relevant

**If force was used on child:**
- Medical examination crucial
- School records may be relevant
- Therapy/counseling documentation
- Developmental considerations matter
