### What SB 2 Changed
**Before SB 2:**
- California had NO decertification system
- Officers could be fired but just move to another department
- "Gypsy cops" moving between agencies
- No statewide tracking of serious misconduct

**After SB 2 (effective January 1, 2022):**
- POST can now decertify officers
- Officers must undergo review for serious misconduct
- Advisory board examines cases
- Decertification means can't work as peace officer anywhere in California

### Grounds for Decertification
- Dishonesty related to reporting, investigation, or prosecution
- Abuse of power
- Physical abuse
- Sexual assault
- Discrimination
- Failure to cooperate with investigations
- Wrongful arrests/searches
- Unlawful detention

### The Process
1. Misconduct reported to POST
2. POST staff review
3. POST Advisory Board hearing
4. Decertification decision
5. Appeals process

### Statistics & Impact
- How many officers decertified so far?
- How many cases under review?
- Which agencies have had most decertifications?
- Has it deterred misconduct?

- Some advocates wanted stronger provisions

### National Context
- Most states have had decertification for years
- California was lagging behind
- Now California's system is one of the most comprehensive
- Other states looking to California's model
