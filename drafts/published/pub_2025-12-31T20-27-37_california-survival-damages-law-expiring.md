California's SB 447 Has Lapsed: Survival Damages No Longer Available in Wrongful Death Cases

## Key Points

As of January 1, 2026, California law no longer permits recovery of a decedent's pain and suffering in survival actions. SB 447, the landmark legislation that briefly allowed these damages, contained a sunset provision requiring cases to be filed before January 1, 2026. The legislature has not renewed the law, and California has now reverted to its pre-2022 rule that shields wrongdoers from accountability for the suffering they cause before a victim dies.

This change has immediate practical consequences: any wrongful death complaint filed on or after January 1, 2026 can no longer plead survival damages for the decedent's pain, suffering, or disfigurement. For civil rights attorneys handling police misconduct and excessive force cases, this represents a significant step backward.

Consider a hypothetical that illustrates the absurdity of this outcome: A person is shot by police and survives the initial encounter, but the injuries are catastrophic. They spend a year in the hospital, enduring multiple surgeries, infections, and unimaginable pain. They are conscious throughout—aware of their suffering, aware of their declining condition, aware that they are dying. After twelve months of agony, they succumb to their injuries.

Under California's current law, that year of documented, undeniable suffering has no compensable value in a survival action. The decedent's estate can recover only economic losses—medical bills, lost wages—but nothing for the lived experience of pain that the victim actually endured. The wrongdoer receives what the original SB 447 sponsors correctly identified as "a windfall": the fortuitous timing of death erases accountability for the harm inflicted.

This outcome defies basic principles of justice. We do not typically allow tortfeasors to escape liability simply because their victim eventually died. If the same person had survived that year of suffering, they could recover full damages for their pain. But because they died—often because of the severity of the very injuries the defendant caused—the law now says that suffering doesn't count.

California remains in the minority of states that bar non-economic survival damages. The brief window of SB 447 acknowledged what most jurisdictions recognize: that a person's pain is real, compensable harm regardless of whether they ultimately survive. The legislature's failure to renew this common-sense reform is disappointing.

For practitioners, this means adjusting litigation strategy. Cases involving pre-death suffering that might have been filed in early 2026 needed to be on file before the deadline. Going forward, wrongful death damages are limited to the losses suffered by the surviving family members—loss of consortium, loss of financial support, funeral expenses—rather than the decedent's own experience.

The policy arguments for survival damages remain as compelling as they were when SB 447 passed. Accountability should not depend on whether a victim lives or dies. The suffering a person endures is real whether it lasts a day or a year, whether they recover or succumb. A legal system that ignores this reality protects wrongdoers at the expense of victims and their families.

## Notes
- Emphasize the news hook: this just happened as of January 1, 2026
- Keep the tone accessible but substantive
- The hypothetical should be vivid enough to make the policy point clear
- Could add external links to news coverage of the lapse if available
- May want to include a call to action regarding legislative advocacy
