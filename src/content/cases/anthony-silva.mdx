**Content Warning:** This article contains descriptions of police violence that resulted in severe injury and death, including graphic details about spinal injuries. Body camera footage depicts the violent incident.

On the afternoon of October 8, 2022, 39-year-old Anthony Silva's life was forever altered during what should have been a routine police encounter at the Riverbank Community Center in Stanislaus County, California. Within minutes of deputies approaching Silva for suspected public intoxication, a violent takedown would leave him paralyzed from the neck down with catastrophic cervical fractures. Nearly a year later, on September 10, 2023, Silva died from complications related to his injuries—a tragic end to a case that has raised serious questions about police use of force and accountability.

Silva, a high school graduate who had been experiencing housing instability, was sitting peacefully near a gazebo at the public facility when Deputies Bret Babbit and Lauren Romero first encountered him. The mounted officers called in a public intoxication report, prompting Deputies Anthony Camara and Steven Xiong to respond on bicycles. What began as a non-violent detention for a minor offense would escalate into a use of force incident that would prove fatal.

## The Violent Encounter

According to court documents and body camera footage, Silva initially complied with deputies' commands during his detention. Deputies Camara and Xiong led him to the nearby gazebo where they were joined by Deputy Bavaro. During their conversation with Silva, the situation took a dramatic turn when deputies decided to arrest him after discovering what they believed to be drugs during a search.

As they walked Silva toward their patrol car for booking, Deputy Camara claims Silva "shoulder-checked" him. Body camera footage from three different angles captures what happened next—a forceful takedown that would have devastating consequences.

The video evidence shows Deputies Camara, Xiong, and Bavaro executing what they described as a takedown, forcibly slamming Silva head-first into the ground. The impact was severe enough to fracture Silva's cervical vertebrae at C6 and C7—in layman's terms, his neck was broken.

Immediately after hitting the ground, Silva told the deputies, "I'm paralyzed." Despite this clear indication of a serious medical emergency, the deputies' response was inadequate and potentially harmful. Rather than immediately calling for medical assistance and stabilizing Silva's neck, they moved his limp body multiple times—first lifting him to a nearby bench, then to a picnic table, sitting him upright without any neck support.

These movements, performed without proper medical training or equipment, likely exacerbated Silva's spinal cord injuries. Medical experts would later determine that the delay in proper medical care and the unnecessary movement of his injured body contributed directly to the extent of his paralysis and ultimate death.

## Medical Consequences and Hospitalization

The severity of Silva's injuries became immediately apparent upon arrival at the hospital. Medical imaging revealed complete cervical fractures at the C6 and C7 vertebrae, requiring emergency surgical intervention. Surgeons worked to stabilize his spine with pins and hardware, but the damage to his spinal cord was irreversible.

Silva never left the hospital following the incident. The spinal cord injury left him completely quadriplegic, unable to move or care for himself. Over the following months, he developed numerous complications common to severe spinal cord injuries, including pneumonia in both lower lobes of his lungs and dangerous blood clots. After suffering for nearly a year, Silva succumbed to his injuries on September 10, 2023.

## Failures in Reporting and Accountability

Perhaps as troubling as the initial use of force was the department's handling of the incident aftermath. Deputy Camara, who authored the use of force report, and Sergeant Hickman, who approved it, were both notified by hospital staff that Silva was in the ICU with severe neck fractures. Despite this knowledge, their official reports failed to accurately reflect the seriousness of the force used or the catastrophic injuries sustained.

Reading the official use of force documentation, one would have no indication of how serious the incident was or that Silva's neck had been broken. This represents either gross negligence in record-keeping or a deliberate attempt to minimize the severity of what occurred—what civil rights attorneys describe as a potential cover-up.

The department's failures extended beyond inadequate reporting. Despite California law requiring notification of the Department of Justice for serious use of force incidents, the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department never reported Silva's case to the state DOJ. The incident only came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's office after media coverage of the subsequent civil lawsuit, prompting the DA to inquire about the case.

## Investigation and Legal Outcomes

When the District Attorney's office finally learned of the incident through media reports rather than proper channels, they conducted their own investigation. However, in a decision that has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates, the DA ultimately decided not to press criminal charges against any of the involved deputies.

The lack of criminal charges stands in stark contrast to the severity of the incident and its fatal outcome. Silva's family, represented in federal court, has filed a comprehensive civil rights lawsuit alleging excessive force, deliberate indifference to medical needs, and a pattern of constitutional violations by the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department.

The federal civil rights case, filed in the Eastern District of California, is set for trial on January 5, 2026. Originally filed by Silva himself, the case was continued by his mother, Dorothy Heimbach, following his death. The lawsuit seeks accountability not just for the individual deputies involved, but for the systemic failures in training, supervision, and reporting that allowed this tragedy to occur.
