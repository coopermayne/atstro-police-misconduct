On October 8, 2022, Anthony Silva, a 39-year-old man experiencing housing instability, died from injuries sustained during an arrest by Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputies near the Riverbank Community Center. Silva was initially approached by deputies for public intoxication, but the encounter escalated when deputies forcefully slammed him head-first to the ground, fracturing his C6 and C7 cervical vertebrae. Silva was rendered quadriplegic and died eleven months later on September 10, 2023, from complications related to his injuries.

The incident began when mounted Deputies Brett Babbit and Lauren Romero observed Silva and called for additional units to respond to a public intoxication matter. Deputies Camara and Xiong, patrolling on bicycles, responded to the call. According to court filings, Silva was compliant during the initial contact and offered no resistance when first detained. The deputies led Silva to a nearby gazebo where Deputy Bavaro joined them.

During a search at the gazebo, deputies discovered what they believed to be narcotics. When they informed Silva he would be booked and began walking him toward their patrol vehicle, Silva became agitated. Deputy Camara later claimed that Silva "shoulder checked" him, prompting the use of force. Body camera footage shows Deputies Camara, Xiong, and Bavaro forcefully taking Silva to the ground, with his head striking the surface first.

## Immediate Aftermath and Medical Response

Silva immediately told the deputies "I'm paralyzed" after the takedown, according to court documents. Despite this statement and Silva's inability to move, deputies did not immediately call for medical assistance. Instead, they moved Silva's body multiple times—first lifting him from the ground to a park bench, then to a picnic table—without providing neck support. These movements occurred despite Silva's visible distress and statements about his condition.

Silva was eventually transported to a hospital where medical staff discovered severe cervical fractures requiring immediate surgical intervention. The injuries left Silva permanently paralyzed from the neck down. He remained hospitalized for the remainder of his life, developing complications including pneumonia and blood clots before his death nearly one year later.

## Investigation and Reporting Discrepancies

The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department's handling of the incident has drawn scrutiny for multiple reporting failures. Deputy Camara's use of force report, approved by Sergeant Hickman, failed to accurately reflect the severity of the force used or Silva's resulting injuries. Despite hospital staff notifying both Camara and Hickman that Silva was in the ICU with severe neck fractures, the official documentation did not mention the broken neck or the extent of Silva's injuries.

<DocumentCard title="Use of Force Report" description="Report written by Deputy Camara and approved by Hickman that fails to reflect seriousness of force" url="https://pub-94ffb76bcbf1479e8e126efb9a35c91b.r2.dev/use-of-force-report-20251114191640.pdf" />

The department also failed to report the incident to the California Department of Justice as required by state law when serious injuries occur during law enforcement encounters. The case only came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's office after they learned about it through media coverage of the subsequent civil lawsuit. The DA's office ultimately declined to file criminal charges against the involved deputies.

## Legal Proceedings

Silva's mother, Dorothey Heimbach, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. The case, initially filed by Silva before his death, proceeded with Heimbach as the substitute plaintiff after Silva died. The lawsuit alleges excessive force, failure to provide adequate medical care, and systemic deficiencies in department training and oversight.

<DocumentCard title="Second Amended Complaint" description="Federal civil rights complaint filed against Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department regarding Anthony Silva's case" url="https://pub-94ffb76bcbf1479e8e126efb9a35c91b.r2.dev/second-amended-complaint-20251114191639.pdf" />

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California before Judge Calabretta, with trial scheduled for January 5, 2026. The lawsuit contends that Silva posed no threat to officers at any point during the encounter and that the use of force was unjustified given his compliance with initial commands and the non-violent nature of the alleged offense.

Court filings indicate that Silva was a high school graduate who had been experiencing housing instability for several years before the incident. The lawsuit argues that the deputies' actions violated Silva's constitutional rights and that the department's inadequate training and supervision contributed to the outcome.
