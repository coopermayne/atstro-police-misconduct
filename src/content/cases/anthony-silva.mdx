Anthony Silva, a 39-year-old man, died on September 10, 2023, from complications related to cervical fractures sustained during an arrest by Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputies on October 8, 2022. The incident occurred near the Riverbank Community Center in Riverbank, California, and resulted in Silva becoming quadriplegic before his death nearly one year later.

Silva was initially contacted by mounted deputies Brett Babbit and Lauren Romero for public intoxication. The encounter escalated when bike patrol deputies David Camara and Kao Xiong responded to the call. After searching Silva and finding what they believed to be drugs, the deputies decided to book him. As they walked him toward their patrol car, Silva became agitated, leading to the use of force incident.

According to court filings, Deputy Camara claimed Silva "shoulder-checked" him before the takedown, though this account is disputed in the civil lawsuit. Body camera footage shows deputies Camara, Xiong, and Timothy Bavaro forcibly slamming Silva head-first to the ground. The impact caused fractures to Silva's C6 and C7 cervical vertebrae.

Immediately following the takedown, Silva told the deputies "I'm paralyzed." Despite his statement and visible inability to move, the deputies did not immediately call for medical assistance. Instead, they moved Silva's body multiple times—first lifting him from the ground to a park bench, then to a picnic table—without providing neck support. Court documents allege these movements exacerbated his spinal injuries.

Silva was hospitalized and never left medical care. He underwent surgery to stabilize his neck fractures, requiring the placement of multiple pins and hardware. Despite medical intervention, Silva remained quadriplegic and died from complications related to his injuries on September 10, 2023.

## Legal Proceedings

Silva's mother, Dorothey Heimbach, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California after initially being named as plaintiff when Silva was still alive. The case, numbered 2:23-cv-01887-DJC-KJN, is assigned to Judge Calabretta with trial scheduled for January 5, 2026.

The lawsuit alleges excessive force, failure to provide medical care, and inadequate training and supervision by the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. According to the complaint, Silva posed no threat to officers, was unarmed, and had complied with all commands prior to the use of force.

## Reporting and Investigation Issues

The case has raised questions about the accuracy and completeness of official reporting. Deputy Camara's use of force report, approved by Sergeant Hickman, allegedly failed to accurately reflect the severity of the force used or the extent of Silva's injuries, despite both officers being notified by hospital staff that Silva was in the ICU with severe neck fractures.

The department also allegedly failed to report the incident to the California Department of Justice as required by law. The case only came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's Office after media coverage of the civil lawsuit prompted an inquiry. Following investigation, the DA's office declined to file criminal charges against the involved deputies.
