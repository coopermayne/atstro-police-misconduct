**Content Warning:** This article contains descriptions of police violence that resulted in severe injury and death, including graphic details about spinal injuries. Body camera footage depicts the violent incident.

On October 8, 2022, Anthony Silva sustained fatal injuries during a police encounter at the Riverbank Community Center in Stanislaus County, California. The 39-year-old died on September 10, 2023, from complications of cervical fractures at the C6 and C7 vertebrae sustained when deputies forcibly slammed him head-first to the ground during his arrest. The incident has raised questions about police use of force protocols and departmental accountability.

Silva, a high school graduate who had been experiencing housing instability, was sitting on the grass near a gazebo at the public facility when Deputies Bret Babbit and Lauren Romero first encountered him. The mounted officers called in a public intoxication report, prompting Deputies Anthony Camara and Steven Xiong to respond on bicycles. Deputy Camara initially tackled Silva on the grass and placed him in handcuffs before escorting him to the nearby gazebo.

## The Incident

According to court documents and body camera footage, after the initial takedown on the grass and handcuffing, Deputies Camara and Xiong escorted Silva to the nearby gazebo where they were joined by Deputy Bavaro. During their interaction with Silva at the gazebo, deputies discovered what they believed to be drugs during a search and decided to transport him for booking.

As they walked Silva toward their patrol car, Deputy Camara reported that Silva "shoulder-checked" him. Body camera footage from three different angles documents what followed—a forceful takedown that resulted in fatal injuries.

The video evidence shows Deputies Camara, Xiong, and Bavaro executing what they described as a takedown, forcibly slamming Silva head-first into the ground. The impact fractured Silva's cervical vertebrae at C6 and C7, injuries from which he would die eleven months later.

Immediately after hitting the ground, Silva stated, "I'm paralyzed." Rather than immediately calling for medical assistance and stabilizing Silva's neck, deputies moved his body multiple times—first lifting him to a nearby bench, then to a picnic table, sitting him upright without neck support.

Medical experts later determined that the delay in proper medical care and the movement of Silva's injured body without spinal stabilization contributed to the extent of his injuries and subsequent death.

## Medical Treatment and Death

Medical imaging at the hospital revealed complete cervical fractures at the C6 and C7 vertebrae, requiring emergency surgical intervention. Surgeons stabilized Silva's spine with pins and hardware, but the spinal cord damage was irreversible.

Silva remained hospitalized from the date of the incident until his death. The spinal cord injury resulted in complete quadriplegia. Over the following months, he developed complications including bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and blood clots. Silva died from complications related to his injuries on September 10, 2023, nearly eleven months after the incident.

## Departmental Response and Reporting

Deputy Camara authored a use of force report that was approved by Sergeant Hickman. Both were notified by hospital staff that Silva was in the ICU with severe neck fractures. According to the civil lawsuit, the official reports did not accurately reflect the severity of the force used or the injuries sustained.

The use of force documentation did not indicate the seriousness of Silva's injuries or the cervical fractures. Civil rights attorneys representing Silva's family have alleged this constituted an attempt to minimize the severity of the incident.

Despite California law requiring notification of the Department of Justice for serious use of force incidents, the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department did not report Silva's case to the state DOJ. The incident came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's office after media coverage of the civil lawsuit.

## Investigation and Legal Proceedings

The District Attorney's office conducted an investigation after learning of the incident through media reports. The DA decided not to file criminal charges against any of the involved deputies.

Silva's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging excessive force, deliberate indifference to medical needs, and a pattern of constitutional violations by the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department.

The federal civil rights case, filed in the Eastern District of California, is scheduled for trial on January 5, 2026. Originally filed by Silva before his death, the case was continued by his mother, Dorothy Heimbach. The lawsuit seeks damages and alleges systemic failures in training, supervision, and reporting.
