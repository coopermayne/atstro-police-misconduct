On October 8, 2022, Anthony Silva, a 39-year-old man experiencing housing instability, was at a gazebo near the Riverbank Community Center when an encounter with Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputies resulted in severe cervical fractures that rendered him quadriplegic. Silva died nearly one year later on September 10, 2023, from complications related to his injuries. The incident has prompted a federal civil rights lawsuit and raised questions about the department's use-of-force policies and incident reporting practices.

The encounter began when Deputies Bret Babbitt and Lauren Romero, who were on horseback patrol, initiated a public intoxication call at the Riverbank Community Center at 3600 Santa Fe Street. Deputies Camara and Xiong, patrolling on bicycles, responded to the call. According to court filings, Silva was compliant during the initial contact and arrest. The deputies conducted a search after taking Silva to a nearby gazebo, where they reportedly found what they believed to be drugs. When the decision was made to book Silva and deputies began walking him to their patrol car, Silva became agitated, leading to the use of force.

Deputy Camara claimed that Silva "shoulder checked" him immediately before the takedown. However, body camera footage captured the subsequent events, showing Deputies Camara, Xiong, and Bavaro forcefully slamming Silva head-first to the ground. The impact caused fractures to Silva's C6 and C7 vertebrae, resulting in immediate paralysis.

Immediately following the takedown, Silva told the deputies, "I'm paralyzed." Despite this clear indication of serious injury, the deputies did not immediately call for paramedics. Instead, they moved Silva's body multiple times without providing neck support, first lifting him to a nearby bench and later to a picnic table. These movements exacerbated his spinal injuries. The delay in medical care and repeated movement of Silva's body contributed to the severity of his permanent quadriplegia.

## Medical Treatment and Consequences

Silva was transported to a hospital where medical personnel diagnosed severe cervical fractures requiring immediate surgical intervention. The injuries necessitated the placement of multiple surgical pins to stabilize his neck vertebrae.

Silva remained hospitalized for the duration of his life following the incident. His condition led to various complications including pneumonia in both lower lobes of his lungs and blood clots. He died on September 10, 2023, with his death attributed to complications from the injuries sustained during the police encounter.

## Reporting and Documentation Issues

The incident's documentation has become a significant aspect of the case. Deputy Camara's use-of-force report, approved by Sergeant Hickman, failed to accurately convey the severity of the force used or the resulting injuries. Despite both Camara and Hickman being notified by hospital personnel that Silva was in intensive care with severe neck fractures, the official reports did not reflect the seriousness of the incident or its consequences.

The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department also failed to report the incident to the California Department of Justice as required by state law. The incident only came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's office after the DA learned of it through media coverage of the civil lawsuit and subsequently inquired about the case.

## Legal Proceedings

Silva initially filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. Following his death, his mother, Dorothy Heimbach, substituted as plaintiff in the case. The lawsuit is filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California (Case No. 2:23-cv-01887-DJC-KJN) before Judge Calabretta, with trial scheduled for January 5, 2026.

The District Attorney's office conducted an investigation after learning of the incident but ultimately decided not to file criminal charges against the involved deputies. No administrative investigation by the sheriff's department has been reported.

## Body Camera Evidence

Multiple body camera videos from the involved deputies captured the incident, providing visual documentation of the force used and Silva's immediate response. The footage shows the takedown from different angles and Silva's immediate claim of paralysis following the impact.

The case highlights ongoing concerns about police use of force, particularly in situations where subjects are compliant and pose no immediate threat. Silva's death has drawn attention to the need for proper medical response following use-of-force incidents and accurate documentation of such encounters by law enforcement agencies.
