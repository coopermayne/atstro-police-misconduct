On October 8, 2022, Anthony Silva, a 39-year-old high school graduate experiencing housing instability, was approached by Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputies near the Riverbank Community Center in Riverbank, California. What began as a public intoxication investigation resulted in Silva sustaining severe cervical fractures that rendered him quadriplegic. Silva died on September 10, 2023, nearly one year after the incident, from complications related to his injuries.

The incident occurred at approximately 3600 Santa Fe Street, near a gazebo that serves as a public facility. Deputies Brett Babbit and Lauren Romero, who were on horseback patrol, initially contacted Silva and called in a public intoxication report. This call prompted the response of Deputies Luis Camara and Xiong, who were on bicycle patrol. Silva was reportedly compliant during the initial contact and arrest.

According to court documents, after searching Silva and discovering what they believed to be drugs, the deputies decided to book him rather than cite and release. Silva allegedly became agitated as they walked him toward their patrol vehicle. Deputy Camara claimed that Silva "shoulder-checked" him, though body camera footage provides visual documentation of the incident for independent assessment.

## The Takedown and Injury

Deputies Camara, Xiong, and Bavaro executed what the lawsuit characterizes as a forceful takedown, slamming Silva head-first into the ground. The impact caused fractures to Silva's C6 and C7 cervical vertebrae. Silva immediately informed the deputies that he was paralyzed, but according to court filings, the officers did not promptly call for medical assistance.

Instead of providing spinal immobilization, the deputies moved Silva's body multiple times. They first lifted him from the ground to a park bench, then later moved him to a picnic table, positioning him upright. Medical experts would later indicate that these movements likely exacerbated the spinal cord damage.

Silva was transported to a hospital, where medical imaging revealed the extent of his injuries. He underwent surgery to stabilize the fractures, requiring the placement of multiple pins and hardware.

## Body Camera Evidence

Multiple deputies' body cameras captured the incident, providing different angles of the encounter. The footage shows the moments leading up to the takedown and the immediate aftermath.

## Documentation and Reporting Issues

The lawsuit alleges significant deficiencies in how the incident was documented and reported. Deputy Camara authored a use of force report that was approved by Sergeant Hickman. According to court filings, both Camara and Hickman were notified by hospital staff that Silva was in the ICU with severe neck fractures, yet the use of force report allegedly fails to accurately reflect the severity of the force used or the resulting injuries.

The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department did not report the incident to the California Department of Justice as required by state law for serious use of force incidents. The incident only came to the attention of the Stanislaus County District Attorney's office through media coverage of the subsequent civil lawsuit, after which the DA's office inquired about the case.

The District Attorney's office ultimately decided not to file criminal charges against the involved deputies. The Sheriff's Department has not conducted an administrative investigation of the incident.

## Civil Litigation

Silva's mother, Dorothey Heimbach, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Stanislaus County and the involved deputies. The case was initially brought by Silva himself, but following his death in September 2023, his mother substituted as the plaintiff. The lawsuit is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California before Judge Calabretta, with trial scheduled for January 5, 2026.

The complaint alleges violations of Silva's constitutional rights, including excessive force, failure to provide medical care, and inadequate training and supervision by the Sheriff's Department. The lawsuit seeks damages for Silva's pain and suffering during his year of quadriplegia, as well as wrongful death damages.

## Background and Context

Silva was described in court documents as having experienced housing instability for several years before the incident. The initial contact with law enforcement was for suspected public intoxication, a misdemeanor offense. Court filings indicate that Silva posed no threat to officers or the public, was unarmed, and was compliant with officers' commands throughout most of the encounter.

The case has drawn attention to use of force policies and training within the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department, as well as the adequacy of incident reporting and oversight mechanisms for serious use of force incidents.
