## The Incident

On June 13, 2024, at approximately 7:45 PM, family members called 911 to report that Magana was in the backyard of a residence in the 14600 block of Cahita Avenue, near Rosecrans Avenue in West Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County near Compton. The caller told dispatchers that Magana was "high on drugs," "inhaling a substance from a canister," and firing a shotgun.

Deputies responded to find Magana in the backyard. He subsequently made his way onto the roof of the home while still armed with the shotgun.

According to the Sheriff's Department, Magana fired four to six rounds at a Sheriff's helicopter that was circling overhead. An inspection of the helicopter after the incident revealed impact marks on a rotor blade, believed to have been caused by at least one round fired by Magana. The round narrowly missed the flight crew.

Deputies attempted to communicate with Magana, including by calling his cell phone. At one point during the standoff, he pointed the gun at his own head. When Magana refused to surrender and fired another shot at the helicopter, two deputies on the ground opened fire.

Magana was struck by gunfire and pronounced dead at the scene. A 12-gauge shotgun and a box of ammunition were recovered from the rooftop.

The neighborhood remained on lockdown through approximately 6:00 AM the following morning as homicide detectives processed the scene and searched for evidence.

## Background

Magana was a 30-year-old Compton resident. According to friends and family who spoke with local media, he had struggled with drug addiction. They described him as someone who grew up playing soccer before becoming involved with drugs. At the time of the incident, he had recently been released from a rehabilitation program. He was survived by a six-year-old daughter.

## Investigation

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau is investigating the shooting. The names of the deputies who fired have not been publicly released.
