## LAPD Officers Use Excessive Force Against Teacher in Traffic Stop

On the evening of June 15, 2023, John Smith, a 35-year-old teacher, became the victim of excessive force by Los Angeles Police Department officers during what began as a routine traffic stop near his home in South Los Angeles. The incident, captured on body camera footage, shows a disturbing escalation of violence against a compliant civilian that ultimately resulted in serious injuries and an $875,000 settlement.

According to case documents and video evidence, Smith was stopped at approximately 8:45 PM for an alleged traffic violation. Body camera footage reveals that the interaction quickly deteriorated when Smith questioned the reason for the stop—a constitutionally protected right. Despite Smith's compliance with officer commands and his non-aggressive demeanor throughout the encounter, Officer Rodriguez deployed a taser against him multiple times without apparent justification.

The situation further escalated when Officer Martinez forcibly removed Smith from his vehicle and placed him in a chokehold while other officers stood by without intervening. This use of a chokehold is particularly concerning given ongoing reforms in police departments nationwide regarding neck restraints following high-profile deaths in police custody.

Smith sustained significant injuries during the encounter, including a dislocated shoulder, fractured ribs, and psychological trauma that required ongoing treatment. Medical documentation shows the severity of the physical harm inflicted during the arrest.

## Legal Action and Civil Rights Violations

On August 15, 2023, Smith filed a federal civil rights lawsuit under 42 USC § 1983, alleging violations of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. The complaint detailed multiple constitutional violations, including:

- Excessive use of force with a taser against a compliant individual
- Use of a prohibited chokehold technique
- Failure of bystander officers to intervene and prevent the excessive force
- Pattern and practice allegations suggesting systemic issues within the LAPD

The officers initially claimed qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects government officials from civil lawsuits unless they violated "clearly established" constitutional rights. However, the case proceeded through the federal court system, indicating that the alleged conduct was sufficiently egregious to overcome this defense.

The legal proceedings revealed concerning patterns within the department. Court filings suggested this was not an isolated incident but part of broader issues with use of force policies and officer training within the LAPD. The failure of multiple officers to intervene while witnessing the excessive force raised additional questions about departmental culture and accountability mechanisms.

**June 15, 2023 - 9:00 PM (approx.):** Officers escalate force, using taser and chokehold on compliant Smith

**June 16, 2023:** Smith hospitalized for treatment of injuries including dislocated shoulder and fractured ribs

**July 2, 2023:** LAPD Internal Affairs Division opens investigation into the incident

**August 15, 2023:** Smith files federal civil rights lawsuit under 42 USC § 1983 in U.S. District Court

**March 12, 2024:** Case settles for $875,000 with no admission of wrongdoing by the department

## Settlement and Ongoing Concerns

The case concluded with a settlement of $875,000 in March 2024, reflecting the serious nature of the constitutional violations alleged. Notably, the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing by the LAPD or the individual officers involved—a standard provision in such agreements that allows departments to resolve cases without acknowledging fault.

Perhaps most troubling, both Officer Rodriguez and Officer Martinez remain on active duty with the LAPD. The department has not disclosed whether any disciplinary action was taken against the officers or if any policy changes were implemented as a result of this incident. This lack of accountability raises questions about the department's commitment to preventing similar incidents in the future.

The settlement amount, while substantial, represents taxpayer funds used to compensate for officer misconduct while the officers responsible continue in their positions with apparent impunity. This pattern of financial settlements without meaningful accountability has been criticized by civil rights advocates as insufficient to deter future misconduct.

## Legal Status

The civil lawsuit has been resolved through the March 2024 settlement. No criminal charges were filed against the officers involved. The internal affairs investigation's findings have not been made public, and both officers remain on active duty with the Los Angeles Police Department.

The case highlights ongoing challenges with police accountability and the use of excessive force, particularly in communities of color where such incidents disproportionately occur. It also underscores the importance of body camera footage in documenting police misconduct and providing evidence for civil rights litigation.
