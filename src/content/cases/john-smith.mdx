# LAPD Officers Use Excessive Force During Traffic Stop, Tasing Compliant Teacher

On the evening of June 15, 2023, what began as a routine traffic stop in South Los Angeles escalated into a violent encounter that left 35-year-old teacher John Smith hospitalized with serious injuries. Body camera footage captures the disturbing incident in which LAPD officers used a taser multiple times and placed Smith in a chokehold, despite his compliance with their commands.

The incident occurred at approximately 8:45 PM near Smith's home when Officers Rodriguez and Martinez pulled him over for an alleged traffic violation. According to court documents, Smith questioned why he was being stopped—a constitutionally protected right—but showed no signs of aggression and complied with all officer commands. Nevertheless, the situation rapidly deteriorated when Officer Rodriguez deployed his taser on Smith multiple times without apparent justification.

The body camera footage reveals the extent of the officers' misconduct. After the initial tasing, Officer Martinez forcibly removed Smith from his vehicle and placed him in a chokehold while other officers stood by without intervening. Smith's injuries were severe, including a dislocated shoulder, fractured ribs, and lasting psychological trauma from the encounter.

Smith's case highlights ongoing issues with excessive force within the LAPD and raises serious questions about officer training and accountability. Despite the clear evidence of misconduct captured on body cameras, both officers remain on active duty. The incident adds to a growing pattern of excessive force allegations against the department, which has faced federal oversight in the past for similar violations of constitutional rights.

## Legal Proceedings and Constitutional Violations

Smith's lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleged multiple constitutional violations under the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures. The complaint specifically cited excessive force, arguing that the officers' use of tasers and physical restraint was objectively unreasonable given Smith's compliance and lack of threat to officer safety.

The officers initially attempted to claim qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields government officials from civil liability unless they violated clearly established law. However, the strength of the body camera evidence and the clearly established nature of the constitutional violations made this defense untenable.

The case also raised allegations of a pattern and practice of excessive force within the LAPD, with Smith's attorneys arguing that the department's training and policies inadequately address de-escalation and the appropriate use of force. Additionally, the lawsuit highlighted the failure of bystander officers to intervene—a violation of their duty to prevent the use of excessive force by colleagues.

## Settlement and Ongoing Accountability Issues

In March 2024, the City of Los Angeles agreed to settle Smith's lawsuit for $875,000, though the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing. This substantial payout reflects the strength of Smith's case and the clear nature of the constitutional violations captured on video.

However, the settlement raises troubling questions about accountability within the LAPD. Despite the clear evidence of misconduct, both Officer Rodriguez and Officer Martinez remain on active duty with no apparent disciplinary action. The internal affairs investigation, which began in July 2023, has not resulted in any public findings or consequences for the officers involved.

This lack of accountability perpetuates a culture within law enforcement where officers can violate citizens' constitutional rights with impunity, knowing that the financial consequences will be borne by taxpayers rather than individual officers or the department itself.
