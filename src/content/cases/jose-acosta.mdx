## The Incident

On March 19, 2024, at approximately 9:18 PM, deputies from the Lakewood Sheriff's Station responded to the 15900 block of Indiana Avenue in Paramount regarding a restraining order violation. A woman reported that Acosta had come to her residence and demanded to be let inside, in violation of a protective order.

Deputies spotted Acosta driving an orange 1970s-era Pontiac near the woman's home and followed him. They located him stopped at a red light at the intersection of East Artesia Boulevard and Downey Avenue in Long Beach, with three sheriff's vehicles positioned behind him.

Acosta put his vehicle in reverse and accelerated backward, crashing into the front of a patrol unit. The collision deployed the deputy's airbag and rendered both vehicles inoperable. The deputy driving the patrol vehicle sustained injuries and was later hospitalized.

Deputies from another patrol unit ordered Acosta to exit his vehicle with his hands up. When Acosta opened the door, deputies observed he was holding a knife. They commanded him to drop the weapon. According to the Sheriff's Department, Acosta exited the vehicle, fell to the ground while still holding the knife, then stood up and charged at the deputies.

Deputies Hector Macias and Zachary Van Der Zanden opened fire. Acosta was struck and fell to the ground. Deputies rendered medical aid until fire department paramedics arrived. Acosta was pronounced dead at the scene.

A knife with a three-inch blade was recovered from the scene.

## Investigation

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau conducted the investigation. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office reviewed the case and determined the deputies acted reasonably in using deadly force to defend themselves.

The deputy injured in the vehicle collision was treated at a hospital and released.
