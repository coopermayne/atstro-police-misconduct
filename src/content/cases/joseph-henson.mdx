## The Incident

On the morning of February 23, 2024, Henson entered a convenience store at the Shell gas station in the 13000 block of Pearblossom Highway. According to reports, he asked the store clerk to call 911 for an ambulance while threatening to stab the clerk if he refused.

Deputies responded to a report of an assault with a deadly weapon involving a person with a knife. When they arrived, Henson was positioned outside the store. Body camera footage shows deputies repeatedly commanding Henson to drop the object in his hand.

One deputy can be heard stating: "Please don't do this. Drop whatever is in your hand... If you come close to me I'm gonna shoot you."

Despite these warnings, Henson continued to advance toward the deputies. The deputies then opened fire, striking Henson multiple times. He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Deputies recovered a sharp metal tool on a handle at the scene, described as possibly a screwdriver or pick.

## Investigation

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau is investigating the shooting. The department released body camera footage documenting the encounter.

As of this writing, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has not issued a report on this incident.
