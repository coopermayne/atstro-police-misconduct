## Case Summary

On June 20, 2024, Michael Rodriguez, a 28-year-old construction worker, was subjected to excessive force during what should have been a routine traffic stop for expired vehicle registration in San Diego. San Diego Police Department officers escalated the encounter by forcibly removing Rodriguez from his vehicle and deploying a taser twice, despite body camera footage showing he remained calm and compliant throughout the interaction.

The incident highlights a troubling disconnect between official police reports and objective video evidence. While officers claimed in their written report that Rodriguez was "combative" and "acting suspicious," body camera footage tells a dramatically different story. The video clearly shows Rodriguez asking reasonable questions about why he was being removed from his vehicle and receiving no clear answers from officers before being subjected to force.

Rodriguez sustained injuries to his wrists and shoulder from the restraints applied after he was tased and fell to the ground. He incurred approximately $12,000 in medical bills and lost wages from missing work due to his injuries. The case was resolved through a federal civil rights lawsuit that resulted in a $450,000 settlement from the City of San Diego in October 2024.

The case serves as a stark example of how body camera technology can contradict official police narratives and provide crucial evidence in civil rights cases. It also demonstrates the legal challenges faced by officers who attempt to claim qualified immunity when their actions are contradicted by video evidence.

## Legal Status

The case was resolved through a $450,000 settlement agreement reached in October 2024, just months before the case was scheduled to go to trial. The relatively quick resolution came after a federal judge denied the officers' claim for qualified immunity in September 2024, a significant legal victory that allowed the case to proceed.

Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that typically protects government officials from civil lawsuits unless they violated "clearly established" constitutional rights. The judge's denial of this defense suggests that the officers' actions were so clearly inappropriate that no reasonable officer would have believed they were justified under the circumstances.

The settlement amount of $450,000 reflects both the clear evidence of misconduct captured on body camera footage and the injuries sustained by Rodriguez. Beyond his physical injuries and $12,000 in medical expenses, Rodriguez also suffered lost wages from missing work during his recovery period.

The body camera footage serves as the central piece of evidence in this case, providing an objective record that directly contradicts the officers' written reports. The video shows Rodriguez remaining calm and asking legitimate questions about the reason for his removal from the vehicle, behavior that would not justify the use of force deployed against him.

This case demonstrates the critical importance of body camera technology in police accountability. Without this video evidence, Rodriguez's civil rights lawsuit would have relied on his word against the officers' official reports, making it significantly more difficult to prove misconduct occurred.
