**Content Warning: This article contains descriptions of police use of force that some readers may find disturbing.**

On June 15, 2023, what began as a routine traffic stop in South Los Angeles escalated into a controversial use of force incident that would result in a significant civil rights lawsuit. Michael Ross, a 35-year-old teacher with no prior criminal record, was stopped by Los Angeles Police Department officers in what would become a case study in police accountability and excessive force.

The incident, which was captured on body camera footage, shows Ross initially complying with officers' commands during the traffic stop. However, when Ross questioned the reason for the stop—a constitutionally protected right—the situation rapidly deteriorated. Despite his continued compliance with officers' directives, the encounter escalated to the deployment of a taser, resulting in injuries that would require medical attention.

The body camera footage reveals crucial details about the encounter that contradict initial police reports. The video evidence shows Ross posed no threat to officers and was not resisting arrest when the taser was deployed. This discrepancy between the official account and the recorded evidence became central to the subsequent civil rights lawsuit filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the federal statute that allows individuals to sue government officials for violations of their constitutional rights.

Ross's case highlights broader concerns about police accountability in Los Angeles, particularly regarding the use of force against compliant individuals. The incident occurred in South Los Angeles, an area with a complex history of police-community relations. The availability of body camera footage proved crucial in establishing the facts of the case and contradicting the initial police narrative.

**2024**: Case proceeds through federal court system with ongoing discovery and legal proceedings

**Settlement**: Case ultimately resolved with $500,000 settlement to Ross, avoiding trial

## Legal Status

The case was resolved through a $500,000 settlement, indicating the city's recognition of the problematic nature of the officers' actions. This settlement amount reflects the serious constitutional violations alleged in the case, particularly the use of excessive force against a compliant individual who posed no threat.

The lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a federal cause of action for individuals whose constitutional rights have been violated by government officials acting under color of law. In this case, Ross alleged violations of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure and excessive force.

The settlement terms typically include no admission of wrongdoing by the city or officers, but the substantial payout suggests recognition of the strength of Ross's case. The availability of body camera footage showing Ross's compliance and the unjustified use of force likely played a significant role in the city's decision to settle rather than proceed to trial.
