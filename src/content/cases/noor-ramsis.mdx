## The Incident

On January 13, 2024, Deputies Jonathan Sandoval and James Becerra from Century Station were on patrol when witnesses flagged them down near Florence Avenue. The witnesses reported that Ramsis had just committed a robbery and provided a description along with his direction of travel.

Sandoval drove westbound on Florence Avenue and observed Ramsis matching the description. He drew his firearm and ordered Ramsis to show his hands. Body camera footage shows Ramsis looking over his left shoulder and continuing to walk away from the deputies.

According to the District Attorney's report, as Ramsis turned his upper body toward Sandoval, the deputy observed Ramsis holding a box in his left hand and a firearm in his right hand. The DA's report states that Ramsis held the gun at chest level with the muzzle pointed toward the deputy. Believing Ramsis was about to fire, Sandoval discharged his weapon six times. However, the body camera footage does not clearly show Ramsis pointing the firearm at the deputies. The video shows Ramsis walking away from the officers when he was shot, raising questions about whether he was given sufficient time to comply with orders.

A loaded firearm was recovered at the scene. Ramsis sustained five gunshot wounds to his face, abdomen, lower back, and left thigh. He was transported to Saint Francis Medical Center, where he was pronounced deceased at approximately 3:51 PM.

## Background

According to the District Attorney's investigation, Ramsis had previously been employed at a liquor store in Bell Gardens and was aware the owner kept a Glock 19 9mm semi-automatic firearm under the counter.

An autopsy conducted on February 1, 2024, determined the cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds. Toxicology testing revealed the presence of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine (PCP) in Ramsis' blood.

## Investigation

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office Justice System Integrity Division investigated the shooting. On November 21, 2025, the DA's office released its report concluding that Deputy Jonathan Sandoval acted in lawful self-defense when he fired his service weapon. The investigation found that the evidence was consistent with Sandoval's account of the incident.

No criminal charges were filed against the deputies involved.
