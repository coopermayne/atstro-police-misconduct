## Case Summary

On March 10, 2024, Sarah Johnson became the victim of excessive force during what should have been a routine wellness check in Oakland, California. Johnson, who was experiencing a mental health crisis, had reached out for help but instead encountered Oakland Police Department officers who escalated the situation through the use of force.

The incident occurred at Johnson's apartment in Oakland, where officers responded to a wellness check call. Rather than employing de-escalation techniques or crisis intervention protocols, the responding officers forced entry into Johnson's residence. Despite Johnson not posing any immediate physical threat to the officers or others present, she was subjected to multiple taser deployments.

This case highlights critical systemic issues within the Oakland Police Department's approach to mental health emergencies. The officers involved reportedly lacked proper crisis intervention training, a deficiency that directly contributed to the unnecessary use of force against a vulnerable individual seeking assistance during a mental health emergency.

The Johnson family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Oakland Police Department in May 2024, seeking accountability for the excessive force used against Sarah and demanding reforms to prevent similar incidents. The case remains active in federal court as of the last update.

## Legal Status

The case of Sarah Johnson v. Oakland Police Department was filed in federal court in May 2024 and remains in active litigation. The lawsuit alleges violations of Johnson's civil rights under federal law, specifically challenging the use of excessive force during the wellness check incident.

The legal action seeks both monetary damages for the harm inflicted upon Johnson and systemic reforms within the Oakland Police Department. The family's attorneys are likely pursuing claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which allows individuals to sue government officials for violations of constitutional rights, including the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizure through excessive force.

The case underscores broader concerns about law enforcement's handling of mental health crises and the need for proper training in crisis intervention techniques. The outcome may have implications for Oakland PD's policies and training protocols regarding wellness checks and mental health emergency responses.

## Key Issues

This case raises several critical issues regarding police response to mental health emergencies:

**Crisis Intervention Training Deficiency**: The responding officers reportedly lacked adequate crisis intervention training, which is essential for safely managing mental health emergencies. This training gap directly contributed to the escalation rather than de-escalation of the situation.

**Use of Force Policy**: The deployment of tasers against someone experiencing a mental health crisis who posed no immediate threat raises questions about the department's use of force policies and whether they adequately protect vulnerable individuals.

**Wellness Check Protocols**: The incident highlights the need for specialized protocols when responding to wellness checks, particularly those involving individuals in mental health crisis situations.

## Broader Context

The Johnson case is part of a larger national conversation about the intersection of law enforcement and mental health services. Studies have shown that individuals with mental health conditions are disproportionately likely to experience use of force during police encounters, even when they pose no threat to officers or others.

Many police departments across the country have implemented Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training and other specialized programs to better equip officers for mental health emergencies. The absence of such training in this case demonstrates the urgent need for comprehensive reform in how law enforcement agencies approach mental health crisis response.
