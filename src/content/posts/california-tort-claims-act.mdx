## The 6-Month Deadline That Could End Your Case

If you're injured by a California police officer, sheriff's deputy, or other government employee, you face a critical deadline that most people don't know about: the **California Tort Claims Act** (CTCA).

Before you can sue a government entity in California, you must file a formal claim with that entity within **six months** of the incident.

## What Is the California Tort Claims Act?

The California Tort Claims Act (California Government Code §§ 810-996.6) establishes procedures and limitations for lawsuits against government entities and their employees.

### Key Requirements

1. **Administrative Claim**: File a written claim with the appropriate government entity
2. **Six-Month Deadline**: Claims must be filed within 6 months of the incident
3. **Specific Content**: Claims must include specific information about the incident
4. **Wait Period**: You must wait for the claim to be denied before filing a lawsuit

## Who Must File CTCA Claims?

Anyone seeking damages from:
- Cities and counties
- Police departments and sheriff's offices
- California Highway Patrol
- Other state and local government agencies
- Individual officers and employees (in most cases)

## What Happens If You Miss the Deadline?

Missing the 6-month deadline is usually **fatal to your case**. Courts have limited discretion to excuse late claims, and the exceptions are narrow:

### Possible Exceptions
- **Minority**: Minors have until 6 months after turning 18
- **Incapacity**: Severe mental or physical incapacity preventing claim filing
- **Late Discovery**: Some injury types allow delayed filing if not immediately apparent
- **Application for Late Claim**: Can request permission to file late (rarely granted)

## How to File a Government Claim

### Step 1: Obtain the Proper Form
Most agencies provide claim forms, or you can draft your own following statutory requirements.

### Step 2: Include Required Information
Your claim must include:
- Your name and address
- Date, location, and circumstances of the incident
- Description of injuries or damages
- Amount of compensation sought
- Names of government employees involved (if known)

### Step 3: Submit to the Correct Entity
Determine which government entity employs the officer or owns the property where the incident occurred:
- **LAPD Officer**: City of Los Angeles
- **Sheriff's Deputy**: County (e.g., Los Angeles County)
- **CHP Officer**: California Highway Patrol

### Step 4: Proof of Service
Send the claim via certified mail and keep proof of delivery.

## The Claim Response Process

After filing your claim, the government entity has 45 days to respond. They can:

1. **Approve** the claim (rare)
2. **Deny** the claim
3. **Take no action** (deemed denied after 45 days)

## After Your Claim Is Denied

Once denied, you have **six months** to file a lawsuit in court. If the entity doesn't respond within 45 days, you have **two years** from the date of the incident to file suit.

## Special Considerations for Police Misconduct Cases

Police misconduct cases involve additional complexities:

### Federal vs. State Claims
- **Federal Claims (§1983)**: Don't require CTCA compliance
- **State Claims**: Must follow CTCA procedures
- **Best Practice**: File CTCA claim anyway to preserve all options

### Multiple Defendants
If multiple government entities are potentially liable (e.g., city police and county sheriff), file claims with all entities.

### Criminal Cases
If criminal charges were filed against you, coordinate your civil claim with criminal defense strategy.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Waiting Too Long**: Don't assume you have years to file—you have months
2. **Filing with Wrong Entity**: Research which government body employs the officers
3. **Insufficient Detail**: Provide enough information to allow investigation
4. **Ignoring Response**: Track your claim and respond to requests for information
5. **Missing Lawsuit Deadline**: After denial, you must file suit within 6 months

## Real-World Example

**Jane's Story**: Jane was injured during an arrest by LAPD officers on March 1, 2025. She consulted an attorney in October 2025, seven months after the incident. Because she missed the 6-month deadline to file a government claim, her state law claims were barred. She could only pursue federal civil rights claims, which have different (and sometimes more limited) remedies.

**Lesson**: Contact an attorney immediately after a police misconduct incident.

## SB 2 and Recent Changes

California's police reform law (SB 2) created new causes of action but didn't eliminate CTCA requirements. Claims under the new law still require compliance with the Tort Claims Act.

## Bottom Line: Act Quickly

If you believe you have a claim against a California police department or government entity:

1. **Contact an attorney immediately**—don't wait
2. **Gather evidence** while memories are fresh
3. **File your government claim** well before the 6-month deadline
4. **Preserve all documentation** related to the incident

The California Tort Claims Act's short deadlines are unforgiving. Missing them can destroy an otherwise valid claim, no matter how strong your case.

## Need Help?

If you or a loved one has been harmed by police misconduct in California, consult with a civil rights attorney as soon as possible. The clock is ticking, and protecting your rights requires immediate action.
